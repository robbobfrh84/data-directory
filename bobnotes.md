### TO DO(✅):

Where I left off.
- I added the relatedPages of just the info pages in the department page but still need to get all those fields when they're queried.

- Then, Can i get "relatedDepartmenss" for those pages?
  - IF NO? I can onmount get the department pages and build the contextual nav!
- fix staging/prod radio: Add event to change global currentSite

---
- ✅Style Life Icon: fix style for containers to force live icon to upper left.
- ✅Make Fields response.
- ... refactor field pages
- Build out patches to show 100% of data




Options...
- Update page return data like pages list to have  delay, title etc...
- Get all  
- Add [Copy as graphql query btn]
- Store locally (add refresh btn)
- make fields a table. (color/bold to highlight)
- highlight selected pageType and page.
- alphabetize results
- Loading wheel
- Add "download all as json" Option

Nice to Have
- actually query all the top level queirs and have a "list" of our sites "pages" to show like we have now. THat way adding a new dept. type will just be adding the name to that list.

### WHY? What could this be good for / helpful
- Looking up links to pages,
- If having problems with janin/joplin prod or staging... you can check api status here.
- See what's live
- See what's published
- See what data is available.
